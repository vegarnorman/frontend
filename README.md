# Frontend

Essentially a Gulp/Sass/BrowserSync starter project to get things going faster in a front-end development project.

## How?

1. Clone it
2. `npm install` it
3. `gulp` it

You'll just need to
+ ...put all your images in `src/img`
+ ...stick all your Sass files in `src/scss`
+ ...let your JavaScript live in `src/js`
+ ...let your HTML files hang around in `/public`

If you want to expand on this to use CoffeeScript, EJS, Jade or whatever, feel free to do so.
